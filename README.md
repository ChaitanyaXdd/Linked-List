## Introduction

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to different types of linked lists and their implementations in Java.

## Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List**: A basic linked list where each node points to the next node.


## Operations

The repository includes programs that demonstrate various operations on linked lists, such as:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Reversal
- Searching

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/linked-list-programs.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd linked-list-programs
    ```

3. **Compile and run the programs**:
    ```bash
    javac YourProgram.java
    java YourProgram
    ```
